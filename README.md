# Overview

This is just a sample 'Hello World' program that prints 'Hello World' in large font, ascii art. The program is more for a proof of concept and a practice in formatting more than anything else

# Development Environment

I used an online ascii art generator [by patorjk](https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Graffiti&t=Type%20Something%20) and added characters to escape out of the backslashes used
